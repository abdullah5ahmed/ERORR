New springs, dampers and anti-roll bars complement the included Adaptive M Suspension. BMW also re-tuned the electronic differential and the Dynamic Stability Control to match the upgraded hardware. The interior remains largely unchanged, but Competition Package cars get new lightweight sport seats along with the M-striped woven seat belts. The exterior includes the M Sport exhaust with black chrome tailpipes and high gloss Shadow Line exterior trim. Gloss black trim is added to the kidney grille, side gills, and model badge on the trunk.

With the Competition Package, the coupe version accelerates from standstill to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.0 seconds.

										<h3>bmw i3</h3>
										<p>BMW introduced its I-class electric cars, making the Egyptian market one of the first in the Middle East and North Africa to use the BMW i electric and hybrid car categories This came in light of the government's preparation of the infrastructure for charging electric cars after a republican decision was issued to allow their import without customs duties, which contributes to encouraging the Egyptian consumer to use this type of cars to reduce energy consumption, preserve the environment from dangerous emissions and reduce dependence on fuels due to the high Gasoline price The BMW i3 was launched for the first time in 2011 and is classified as a small hatchback and offers a unique way to open the doors as they open against each other without a stand between them for ease of use and eye catching. The "i3" can accommodate four passengers from the inside, and a storage space of 260 liters increases to 1,100 liters with the rear seats folded The i3 uses a rear-wheel drive system as part of a single-wheel drive mechanism based on electricity only, as it contains a 42-kilowatt battery that supplies the electric motor with power to produce 170 horsepower and 250 Nm of torque, which is delivered through an electric transmission .</p>

										<p>The X6 marks BMW's first use of its new Dynamic Performance Control system, which works in unison with xDrive all-wheel drive, both being standard on the X6. DPC is a drivetrain and chassis control system that works to regulate traction and especially correct over- and understeer by actively spreading out drive forces across the rear axle. Torque is distributed not only between the front and rear wheels (xDrive) but also from side to side at the rear, for improved agility and added stability (through the DPC rear axle).[6] This lateral distribution of torque is commonly known as torque vectoring.</p>
